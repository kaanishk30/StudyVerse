DIFFICULTY ESTIMATION FIX - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Scheduler marking everything as "hard"

ROOT CAUSE: Bug in keyword matching - was checking keyword against itself
  WRONG: if keyword in hard_keywords  (always True!)
  RIGHT: if keyword in topic_lower    (checks actual topic)

SOLUTION: Complete rewrite of estimate_difficulty() in app.py (lines 180-320)

KEY FEATURES:
✓ Fixed keyword matching bug
✓ Balanced scoring (no bias toward any difficulty)
✓ 63 keywords total (20 easy, 20 medium, 23 hard)
✓ Multi-factor complexity analysis
✓ Adjusted thresholds (easy ≤2, medium 3-5, hard >5)

HOW TO TEST:
1. python app.py
2. Go to Study Planner
3. Enter test syllabus (see TEST_DIFFICULTY_FIX.md)
4. Verify topics are correctly labeled

EXPECTED RESULTS:
"Introduction to Python" → easy ✓
"Python Programming" → medium ✓
"Advanced Machine Learning" → hard ✓
"Quantum Computing" → hard ✓

STATUS: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING

FILES:
- app.py (modified)
- TEST_DIFFICULTY_FIX.md (testing instructions)
- DIFFICULTY_ESTIMATION_VERIFICATION.md (technical details)
- TASK_7_COMPLETE.md (full summary)
